3. Multiplication Table
A shopkeeper wants to calculate bulk pricing for a product. If one item costs ₹n, then cost for multiple quantities can be calculated using multiplication.
Write a program to print the **multiplication table of a given number up to 10 using loops**.

Input: n = 6
Output:
6 x 1 = 6
6 x 2 = 12
...
6 x 10 = 60
'''
n=int(input("n="))
for i in range (1,11):
    print(n,'x',i,'=',n*i )


j=1
while j<=10:
    t=n*j
    j=j+1
    print(n,"x",j,"=",t)
