8. Count Multiples of 5 Between Two Numbers
A supermarket gives coupons to customers whose token numbers are multiples of 5. The manager enters a token range and wants to know how many eligible token numbers exist.
Write a program to count numbers divisible by 5 between two given numbers using loops.

Input:
1 20

Output:
Count = 4
'''

a,b=map(int,input("Input : ").split(","))
count=1
while a<=20:
    if a%5==0:
        count=count+1
    a=a+1
print("Count =",count)
