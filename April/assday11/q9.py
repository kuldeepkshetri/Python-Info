9. Neon Number LED Unlock Game
You're programming a new LED display game. The game level unlocks only when a neon number is entered.

A neon number is a number where the sum of the digits of its square is equal to the number itself.
Example: 9 → 9² = 81 → 8 + 1 = 9

Accept a number from the player.
Check whether it is a neon number using loops.

If true, display:
Glowing Success! You've found the Neon Number!

Otherwise display:
Try again! Not quite glowing yet.

Input:
9

Output:
Glowing Success! You've found the Neon Number!
